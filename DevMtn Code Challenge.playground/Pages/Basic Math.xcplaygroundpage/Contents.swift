//: Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers
func Sum (firstNumber: Int, secondNumber: Int) {
     firstNumber + secondNumber
}

//: Write a function that returns the product of two numbers
func Product (firstProduct: Int, secondProduct: Int) {
    firstProduct * secondProduct
}


//: Write a function that returns the average (mean) of an array of numbers
func Mean (arrayOfNumbers: Int) -> Int {
    arrayOfNumbers / arrayOfNumbers
}
//Alright..Im beat.. I want to learn how to make a mean of an array of numbers, but i dont know how to do it 

//: Demo the use of your functions here:
Sum(5, secondNumber: 30)
Product(7, secondProduct: 3)
Mean(<#T##arrayOfNumbers: Int##Int#>)
//: [Previous](@previous)
//: [Next](@next)
